<h2>WEB</h2>

        The World Wide Web, commonly known as the WWW and the Web, is an information 
        space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource 
        Locators (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by 
        hypertext, and are accessible via the Internet.[1] The resources of the WWW may 
        be accessed by users via a software application called a web browser.
        Web resources may be any type of downloadable media, but web pages are hypertext 
        media which have been formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).[2] Such formatting 
        for embedded hyperlinks which contain URLs and permit users to easily navigate to other 
        web resources. In addition to text, web pages may contain images, video, audio, and 
        software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of
        multimedia content.
