    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
        HTML 5 (formerly and commonly spelled HTML5[a]) is a software solution stack that 
        defines the properties and behaviors of web page content by implementing a markup 
        based pattern to it.
        HTML 5 is the fifth and current major version of the HTML standard, 
        and subsumes XHTML. It currently exists in two standardized forms
        : HTML 5.2 Recommendation[4] by the World Wide Web Consortium 
        (W3C, a broad coalition of organizations), intended primarily for Web content 
        developers; and HTML Living Standard[5] by WHATWG 
        (a small consortium of four browser vendors), intended primarily for browser 
        developers, though it also exists in an abridged Web developer version.
        [6] There are minor conflicts between the two groups' specifications.
        HTML 5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,
        [7] with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.
        [2][8] Its goals are to improve the language with support for the latest 
        multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable 
        by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as Web browsers,
        parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with 
        older software. HTML 5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 
        and DOM Level 2 HTML;[9] the HTML 4 and XHTML specs were announced as superseded by 
        HTML 5.2 on 27 March 2018.[10]
